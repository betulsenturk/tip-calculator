## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find a desktop version of the design. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
